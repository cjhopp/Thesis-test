#Dataset
Initial earthquake catalogs for this study are provided by a group at GNS, headed by Steve Sherburn, which is tasked with collecting, and preliminary analysis of, continuous seismic data from the MRP seismograph networks. The MRP data is collected roughly every three months directly from the data loggers. These data are supplemented by data from the GeoNet stations mentioned in the 'Network' section. GeoNet data is sampled at 100 Hz while the MRP network sampled at 200 Hz. For most of this study, these data were resampled at 50 Hz to ease computational costs.

The initial GNS earthquake catalog includes more than 2000 earthquakes which were automatically detected and located by the SeisComP3 software package. As automatic S-phase picking was not implemented, these events were located with P picks only. This condition holds for the entirety of this study. We filtered the catalog to include only events within a 50km^2 bounding box of the center of the geothermal fields and filtered again for events with average pick residuals within 1 standard deviation. The locations of the resulting 637 earthquakes in the context of the seismic network are shown in Fig. 2.

Mighty River Power provided well locations and pumping rates for both the Rotokawa and Ngatamariki geothermal fields for the entire study period.
