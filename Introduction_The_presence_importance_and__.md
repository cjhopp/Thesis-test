#Introduction
The presence, importance and cause of induced seismicity at geothermal power production sites have been recognized for decades \cite{Ward_1972} \cite{Allis_1982}. Commonly, temperature and pressure changes within a reservoir as a result of fluid injection are the culprits, although seismicity has also been attributed to reservoir volume changes and changes in fluid chemistry \cite{Allis_1982} \cite{Sherburn_2015}. Most of this seismicity is of magnitude < 3.0, termed microseismicity, and presents limited hazard to local population and infrastructure. However, it can provide very useful information about the movement of fluid and pressure within the reservoir, and therefore has important implications for geothermal resource management.

Microseismicity at geothermal areas can be highly repetitive in both its triggering process and its spatial extent. It is therefore suited to detection via matched filter which is recognized to be one of the best ways to identify near-repeating signals in continuous data /cite{Gibbons_2006}. It is also suited to earthquake detection in noisy geothermal power generation areas as it relies on signal cross-correlation as opposed to relative amplitudes to search for events \cite{Shelly_2007}. We investigate the performance of matched filtering on a nearly year-long dataset for Ngatamariki and Rotokawa geothermal fields on the north island of New Zealand, focusing on amplifying the number of detections triggered using standard methods and what any additional detections can contribute to our knowledge of the processes at play within the reservoirs.
