#Network
The seismic network used in this study is made up of seismometers operated by MRP (NS\*, RT\*), Contact Energy (THQ2, ARAZ), and GeoNet (WPRZ, PPRZ, HRRZ, ALRZ). Throughout 2015, an average of 25 stations were operational on a day-to-day basis. The network covers an area roughly 30km (NE-SW) by 15km (NW-SE) with the bulk of the stations occupying an area 15km (N-S) by 7km (W-E) around the Rotokawa and Ngatamariki geothermal areas. The MRP surface stations are 4.5Hz Geospace GS-11D instruments whereas the Contact Energy station ARAZ is a 1.0Hz Mark Products L-4C3D sensor.
#Dataset
Initial earthquake catalogs for this study are provided by a group at GNS, headed by Steve Sherburn, which is tasked with collecting, and preliminary analysis of, continuous seismic data from the MRP seismograph networks. The MRP data is collected roughly every three months directly from the data loggers. These data are supplemented by data from
