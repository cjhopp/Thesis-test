#Network
The seismic network used in this study is made up of seismometers operated by MRP (all seismographs named RT and NS in Figure \ref{Figure1}), Contact Energy (THQ2, ARAZ), and GeoNet (WPRZ, PRRZ, HRRZ, ALRZ). Throughout 2015, an average of 25 stations were operational on a day-to-day basis. The network covers an area roughly 30km (NE-SW) by 15km (NW-SE) with the bulk of the stations occupying an area 15km (N-S) by 7km (W-E) around the Rotokawa and Ngatamariki geothermal areas (Figure \ref{Figure1}). The MRP surface stations are 4.5Hz Geospace GS-11D instruments whereas the Contact Energy station ARAZ is a 1.0Hz Mark Products L-4C3D sensor.
