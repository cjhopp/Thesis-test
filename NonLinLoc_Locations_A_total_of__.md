## NonLinLoc Locations
A total of 21,100 detections, after cross correlation of their waveforms with the detecting template, had 6 or more picks with a correlation coefficient of 0.30 or greater. These detections were located with the location program NonLinLoc \cite{Lomax_2014} and are shown in Figure \ref{Figure2} represented as a heatmap showing event density. The maximum density of events is 829 events per km<sup>2</sup>, located in the eastern portion of the Rotokawa field, as has historically been observed \cite{Sherburn_2015}. Events in Ngatamariki are located in two distinct clusters, North and South, again, similar to locations which have previously been reported \cite{Sherburn&Bourguignon_2013} \cite{Sherburn&Bourguignon_2014}.
