#Past work
Microseismicity has been observed at Rotokawa since the start of deep injection in 2005 \cite{Sherburn_2015} and at Ngatamariki since injection operations began in 2012 \cite{Sherburn_2013}. At Rotokawa, the largest portion of microseismiciy since 2012 has been located in the southeast portion of the field as discussed in \cite{Sherburn_2015}, within the polygon shown in \ref{Figure_1}.
