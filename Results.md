## HypoDD relocations
Figures \ref{Figure6} and \ref{Figure7} show HypoDD relocations for Ngatamariki and Rotokawa, respectively, as well as their occurence in time thoughout 2015. In general, the locations paint the same picture as has been reported for the last few years by \cite{Sherburn_2015} and \cite{Sherburn&Bourguignon_2015}, showing a clustering of events within both reservoirs at depths between 1.5 and 3 km. The Rotokawa cluster, when compared to the NonLinLoc locations, remains much the same, albeit collapsed slightly. There appears to be no time dependence of the event locations within the Rotokawa field but, taken as a whole, the cluster is located slightly further to the North and East as compared to the locations presented for 2008-2012 in \cite{Sherburn_2015} (polygon in \ref{Figure7}). At Ngatamariki, the southern cluster of events collapses and moves South, closer to the injection wells NM6 and NM10 as compared to the NonLinLoc locations, while the northern cluster of events actually splits again into eastern and western subclusters. However this may in fact be a product of clustering within HypoDD (the two clusters appear to occur at different depths) and not a real feature. A relatively small number of events were located within the production area near well NM7. Further inquiry is ongoing and will be finalized prior to paper submission. Of note in Figure \ref{Figure6} are small groups of events to the northwest of Ngatamariki which cluster tightly in both space and time. These are quake-aftershock sequences associated with active extension across the axis of the TVZ, including one such sequence near the geothermal area at Orakei-Korako which occurred in mid-May of 2015.
