\label{Figure2} 2015 earthquake density isolines (earthquake/km<sup>2</sup>) for Ngatamariki and Rotokawa geothermal fields including all matched filter detections. The green diamond indicates the area within which most seismicity had occurred from 2008-2012 as published in \cite{Sherburn_2015}. The maximum density (located in Rotokawa) is 456 events per square kilometer. Contour intervals are 30 earthquakes/km<sup>2</sup>. Locations were calculated using NonLinLoc. Seismograph sites are represented by red triangles. Sites not pictured: PRRZ, HRRZ, ALRZ.
