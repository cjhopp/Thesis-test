\label{Figure7} Rotokawa relocations from HypoDD coloured by date of occurrence between 1 January and 20 November, 2015. Blue and red lines indicate injection and production wells, respectively. The injection wells are labeled in map view. Black lines represent faults from the GNS Active Faults Database \cite{AFDB}, unless labeled, in which case they represent inferred faults as published in previous works \cite{wallis2013structural} \cite{Sherburn_2015}. The gray boundaries represent the Boseley \cite{boseley2010resource} and Risk \cite{risk2000electrical} resistivity boundaries shown in Figure \ref{Figure1}. The green diamond indicates the area of densest seismicity from 2008-2012 as published in \cite{Sherburn_2015} and shown in Figure \ref{Figure1}.
