\label{Figure1} Map of the Ngatamariki and Rotokawa geothermal fields, North Island, New Zealand. Red triangles are seismograph sites, black lines represent mapped faults, and green dots represent template events used in the matched filtering process. The goldenrod boundaries are the Boseley \cite{boseley2010resource} and Risk \cite{risk2000electrical} resistivity boundaries for Ngatamariki and Rotokawa respectively. Figure 1a and 1b show detailed maps of Ngatamariki and Rotokawa geothermal fields with pertinent wells labeled. Red wells are production wells whereas blue are injection wells.
